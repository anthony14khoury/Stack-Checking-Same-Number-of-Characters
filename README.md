# Stack Checking Same Number of Characters

This is a C++ build using a stack to check if there are the same number of characters in a string.
Simply, input a word or letter and the program will let you know whether it is true or not.

Explanation:
  - ABBA would return **True** because there are 2 A's and 2 B's
  - ABC would return **False**
